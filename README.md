# 1. Weather App Project

## Description
This project is a simple **Weather App** that displays various weather icons surrounding a central weather icon. The icons are placed in a circular pattern around the center. Each icon represents a different weather condition, and when clicked, it displays the corresponding weather description.

## Features
- Central weather icon.
- Surrounding weather icons arranged in a circular layout.
- Icons are paired with text descriptions.
- Flexible and dynamic layout using `FrameLayout` and `LinearLayout`.

## Methodology
- **Layout:** Used `FrameLayout` as the parent layout to center the main weather icon, and `LinearLayout` for each surrounding icon with a vertical orientation.
- **Positioning:** Used basic trigonometry to calculate the positions of surrounding icons based on a fixed radius.
- **Interaction:** The weather icons are intended to show weather descriptions when interacted with.
