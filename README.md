# 1. Type of food

## Description
This assignment involved creating an Android application to display a list of fruits with their respective calorie counts and images. The application uses a ListView to display items such as fruits, accompanied by their calories and an image for each fruit. The layout also includes a decorative box at the top with fruit emojis to enhance the UI.

## Features
- Fruit List: A list of fruits displayed with their respective calorie counts.
- Images: Each fruit is accompanied by a corresponding image.
- Text Formatting: The fruit names and calorie counts are displayed in a single text field, with calorie counts aligned to the right.
- Custom List View: Customizes the default ListView adapter to include both text and images, with formatting for a clean and visually appealing layout.

## Methodology
- Data Storage: Fruits and their calories are stored in arrays. Each fruit name, calorie count, and image reference are handled separately for easy customization.
- Text Styling: Used SpannableString for aligning text and setting a custom margin for the calorie counts to improve readability.
- Image Handling: Drawable objects are used for each fruit image, which are displayed next to the fruit names.
- UI Design: Designed the layout using a LinearLayout, organizing the fruit list and a styled note section. The list items are dynamically populated using a custom ArrayAdapter.
